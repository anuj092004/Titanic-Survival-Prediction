# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

## 📌 Project Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using Machine Learning algorithms. The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, classification models, and performance evaluation using Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
